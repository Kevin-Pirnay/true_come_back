Liked list : 

This is a small project I created to get back into coding after some time away.
The goal was mainly to refresh my skills and get comfortable with C and data structures again.

Implements a simple heap memory manager
Linked list operations (append, remove, print)
Handling of integer and string data
Just a personal exercise to re-familiarize myself with coding practices and data management in C.
